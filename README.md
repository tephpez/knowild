## FUTURE UPDATES
I would love to add some depth to this site, as the functionality right now is rather basic.
Some things I would like to implement are:<br>
    - auth to allow multiple users to share their finds, growing the archive and potentially community!<br>
    - embedding map functionality - each user can have their own map of all their finds<br>
    - 3rd party plant resource integrated into the site for added research abilities<br>
    - search function so that users can target a specific thing they're looking for <br>
    - sort finds by season so user can know what's available in their area right now<br>
